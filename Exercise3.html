            <h2>Travelling in Depression</h2>
            <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought
                me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has
                given me a unique learning experience.</p>

            <p> At five, I <a href="https://big-logic.github.io/random-password-generator/" target="_blank">marveled</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the city of lights.
                When i was eight,
                I stood in the
                heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways
                on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and
                walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the
                thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in

            <p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first
                became interested in language.
            </p>
            <p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of
                pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris
                where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it
                PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on
                the A, she looked at me bewildered. <br><br />
                In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
                aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
                Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
                different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to
                me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates
                come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
                different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to
                me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates
                come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <a href="milto:Carngbetommy3@gmail.com">Send Us Email</a>
                <br /><br />Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
                school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I
                loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning
                fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means
                volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty
                and rhythm as I form them.</p>
